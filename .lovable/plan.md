## 💌 Generated Experience Pages (one theme per day)

Each day opens a unique themed page when the receiver opens the link:

2. **Propose Day** 💍 — The big "Will you be my Valentine?" with Yes/No buttons (runaway No!)
3. **Chocolate Day** 🍫 — Sweet chocolate-themed reveal with floating cocoa hearts
4. **Teddy Day** 🧸 — Warm, cozy animation with a personalized hug message
5. **Promise Day** 🤞 — An animated promise card that flips open
6. **Hug Day** 🤗 — Warm embrace animation with the personalized message
7. **Kiss Day** 💋 — Elegant floating kiss marks with the love letter
8. **Valentine's Day** ❤️ — The grand finale with all effects combined — confetti, hearts, love letter

## 🎯 The Runaway "No" Button (Star Feature!)
- On Propose Day (and optionally other days), the page asks "Will you be my Valentine?"
- **"Yes" button** stays in place, glowing invitingly

- Each time the No button escapes, a flirty/funny quote appears:
  - *"Haha, nice try! 😏"*
  - *"You can't say no that easily! 💕"*
  - *"Your heart says yes! ❤️"*
